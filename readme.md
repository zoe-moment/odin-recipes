But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
Setting Up Your Project’s GitHub Repository

    Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

Assignment

Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

The recipe page should have the following content:

    An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or the recipe site we linked to earlier.
    Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
    Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
    Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

    Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
    Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.

Viewing your project on the web

If you want to show your work (the project) to others, or submit a solution below, you will need to publish your site so that others can access it from the web, rather than just on your local machine. The good news is that if you have your project on GitHub (as described above), doing this is incredibly simple.

GitHub allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository. Doing this will allow you to access your project from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name.

There are a couple of ways to go about doing this, but the simplest is this:

    make sure that the main HTML file of your project is called index.html. If it is not, you will need to rename it.
    go to your GitHub repo on the web.
    click on the Settings button from the panel at the top.
    click on Pages on the left side bar.
    change the Source from none to main branch and click Save.
    it may take a few minutes (the GitHub website says up to 10, but we’ve seen it take up to an hour. Do not add a “theme” to your project, or you may have git conflicts, instead, be patient.) but your project should be accessible over the web from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name (obviously substituting your own details in the link).
